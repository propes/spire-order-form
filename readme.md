# Spire SPc5 Order Form Test Exercise

## Running the application

To reduce the size of the zip file, node modules have not been included. So `npm install` will need to be run:

```
cd SpireOrderForm
npm install
```

To run the application:

```
cd SpireOrderForm
dotnet run
```

## Testing the application

NUnit tests have been included for the backend controller, which can be run using:

```
cd SpireOrderForm.Tests
dotnet test
```

Due to time constraints front end tests have not been included.
